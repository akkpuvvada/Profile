## 🧠 About Me

I started coding at **age 13**, and today I bring **16+ years of programming** and **8+ years of professional full-stack experience** across **AI, cloud, and mixed-reality systems**.  

I’m currently a **Founding Engineer at WWC.P.C**, where I lead the design of AI-driven financial audit platforms and architect full-stack systems that merge intelligence, scalability, and security.  

I also conduct research at the **University of Houston-Clear Lake (UHCL)** under **Dr. Ross Niswanger**, co-authoring papers on **AI-powered assistive therapy applications** for autistic children and **Vision Pro-based interactive systems**.
